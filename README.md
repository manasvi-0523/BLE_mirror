# BLE Behavioral Fingerprinting Security System

### AI + Blockchain Prototype | by [@manasvi-0523](https://github.com/manasvi-0523) & [@mithun50](https://github.com/mithun50)

A real-time **Bluetooth** device security system that combines **BLE + Classic Bluetooth scanning**, **AI-based anomaly detection** (Isolation Forest), and a **tamper-proof local blockchain** to identify, fingerprint, and flag rogue or spoofed devices in your environment.

## Features

- **Real-Time BLE Scanning** — Captures nearby BLE devices with MAC address, RSSI signal strength, advertised services, and payload size using `bleak`
- **Classic Bluetooth Scanning** — Discovers nearby Classic Bluetooth devices (phones, speakers, laptops) via Windows PnP APIs with proper MAC address extraction
- **RSSI Distance Estimation** — Converts signal strength to approximate distance (meters) using the log-distance path loss model, mapping devices to proximity zones (Near/Medium/Far)
- **Behavioral Fingerprinting** — Extracts a per-device feature vector (mean/std RSSI, payload stats, service count, scan frequency)
- **AI Anomaly Detection** — Trains an Isolation Forest model to flag statistically anomalous devices
- **Blockchain Identity Store** — Each device's behavioral hash is recorded on a local SHA-256 blockchain for tamper-proof audit
- **Automated Alert System** — Anomalous devices trigger `BLOCK` actions, logged to `alerts.csv`
- **Desktop GUI (Kivy)** — Professional dark-themed desktop app with metric cards, distance tracking, device table, and analytics tab
- **Analytics Dashboard** — Built-in donut chart (device type distribution), RSSI signal bars, anomaly score chart, and live pipeline flow diagram
- **One-click EXE Build** — GitHub Actions workflow auto-builds a Windows `.exe` on every push

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

- **OS**: Windows 10/11
- **Python**: 3.10+
- **Bluetooth**: Must be enabled on your machine

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Full Pipeline

```bash
python main.py
```

This will:
1. Scan for nearby BLE and Classic Bluetooth devices
2. Extract behavioral features
3. Train an Isolation Forest model
4. Register each device on the local blockchain
5. Log alerts for anomalous devices

### Run the Desktop GUI

```bash
python gui_app.py
```

The GUI features two tabs:
- **DEVICES** — Real-time device table with status badges, anomaly scores, and RSSI
- **ANALYTICS** — Donut chart (BLE/Classic/Threats), RSSI signal strength bars, anomaly score chart, and a live 4-stage pipeline flow diagram

### Download Pre-built EXE

A Windows `.exe` is automatically built on every push via GitHub Actions.  
Go to **Actions → Build EXE → latest run → Artifacts** to download `BLE_Security_System`.

## How It Works

| Phase | Action | Details |
| ----- | ------ | ------- |
| **1. Scan** | BLE + Classic BT discovery | BLE via `bleak`, Classic via Windows PnP API. MAC addresses extracted and formatted |
| **2. Fingerprint** | Feature extraction | Computes mean/std RSSI, payload stats, service count per device |
| **3. Detect** | Anomaly detection | Isolation Forest flags statistically outlier devices |
| **4. Record** | Blockchain logging | Each device's behavioral hash is stored on a SHA-256 chain |
| **5. Alert** | Threat response | Anomalies trigger `BLOCK` action, logged to `alerts.csv` |
